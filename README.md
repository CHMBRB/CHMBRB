- 👋 Hi, I’m @chmbrb

  - updating this README.md (obviously!)
  - Backend Software Development, Databases, RESTful APIs, etc...
  - Networking, subnetting, and related disciplines
  - Data Analysis
  - Web Development
  - DevOps, docker, and similar related technologies
  - Things that end in "nix" and POSIX systems
  - FLOSS
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - not enough
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
  - whatever calls. If I am able to contribute anything of value even as a friendly "pay-it-forward" then that's good enough.
